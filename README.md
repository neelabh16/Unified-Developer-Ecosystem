# 🌐 DevVerse — Unified Developer Ecosystem

> **A complete developer ecosystem that brings coding, collaboration, learning, hackathons, portfolios, and communities into one unified platform.**

DevVerse is an all-in-one web platform designed for developers, students, and hackathon teams. Instead of switching between multiple platforms for networking, learning, showcasing projects, and collaborating, DevVerse combines everything into a single, immersive experience.

## 📖 Overview

Modern developers use different platforms for every aspect of their journey:

- GitHub for code
- Discord for communities
- Devpost for hackathons
- LinkedIn for professional identity
- Forums and social platforms for technical discussions
- Separate tools for portfolios and networking

**DevVerse unifies these experiences into one ecosystem.**

From discovering hackathons to finding teammates, publishing projects, writing technical knowledge, and engaging with communities — everything happens in one place.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

DevVerse was designed around three core principles:

**Immersive** — Every page is designed to feel like part of one connected ecosystem rather than a collection of unrelated tools.

**Developer-first** — The interface prioritizes functionality, readability, discoverability, and productivity.

**Interactive** — Animations, transitions, hover states, visual feedback, and micro-interactions make the platform feel alive.

## ⚡ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Since DevVerse is a static, client-side project, you only need a modern web browser. A local server is recommended for the best experience (some features rely on relative paths and localStorage).

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/neelabh16/Unified-Developer-Ecosystem.git

# Navigate into the project
cd Unified-Developer-Ecosystem/DevVerse
```

### Running Locally

**Option 1 — Open directly**
```bash
open index.html      # macOS
start index.html      # Windows
xdg-open index.html   # Linux
```

**Option 2 — Serve with a local server (recommended)**
```bash
# Using Python
python3 -m http.server 5500

# Using Node (npx)
npx serve .
```

Then visit `http://localhost:5500` (or the port shown) in your browser.
